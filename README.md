## The FixOurFood agrifood Calculator

The FixOurFood agrifood Calculator is an interactive graphical user interface
(GUI) that allows users to estimate the impacts of a range food system
interventions in several categories, including farming practices, consumption
patterns, land use and innovation.

Datasets employed for the calculations and the modelling pipeline are imported
and built using the [AgriFoodPy](https://github.com/FixOurFood/AgriFoodPy), an
open source Python interoperability layer developed by FixOurFood.

The calculator is deployed on the Streamlit Community Cloud service and the
latest version can be accessed at:
[fixourfood.streamlit.app](fixourfood.streamlit.app)


Developed with funding from [FixOurFood](https://fixourfood.org/)
